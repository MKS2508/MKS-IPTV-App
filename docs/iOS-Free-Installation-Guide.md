TrollStore uses a system vulnerability to permanently sign apps, so they never expire. This method only works on specific, unpatched iOS versions.

### Compatibility

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

- **"Unable to Verify App"**: Make sure you have trusted the developer certificate in your iPhone's settings.
- **"Maximum Number of Apps Installed"**: A free Apple ID only allows for 3 sideloaded apps to be active at one time.
- **AltStore Refresh Fails**: Ensure AltServer is running on your computer and both devices are on the same WiFi network.
